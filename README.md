Link State and Distance Vector Routing

In this project, we will be using the emerging ns-3 discrete network simulator (www.nsnam.org) to design
and implement core routing protocols. Please download the customized ns-3 platform and read project-handout and code documentation for detailed
requirements. If you have any question, please contact the TF (qiao.xiang@cs.yale.edu and yuchen.yang@cs.yale.edu). A corresponding Pizza session will
also be opened soon.
