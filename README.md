# yale-cs433-project:
#Link State and Distance Vector Routing

In this project, we will be using the emerging ns-3 discrete network simulator (www.nsnam.org) to design and implement core routing protocols. Please
download the customized ns-3 platform in this repository and read project-handout and code documentation for detailed requirements. If you have any
question, please contact the TF (qiao.xiang@cs.yale.edu and yuchen.yang@cs.yale.edu). A corresponding Pizza session will also be opened soon.
