		<b>Setting</b>: There is a large body of existing work such as routing, scheduling, and distributed

		management and throughput optimization. It is important that we start with a clear understanding of existing work in

	<div class="maincontentStyleP1">
		<b>Setting</b>: A key benefit of SDN is standardization/whiteboxing of forwarding elements. However, "mainstream" SDN
		data paths focus mostly on wired networks such as data centers on functions such as fast lookup, queueing for QoS,
		instead of issues in wireless functions such as interference management, coding/decoding, although there is also much
		related work on programmable (software defined radio) wireless networks.

		<b>Setting</b>: A key benefit of SDN is logically centralized control. There is a large body of existing work of SDN
		control path, but they are mostly in the context of wired networks such as data center networks and wide-area
		networks (WAN). By control path, we mean the complete spectrum from controller placement, controller fault tolerance,
		controller programming, and controller-forwarding elements integration. This session focuses more in intra-domain
		(i.e., the same trust domain).

		<b>Setting</b>: Just as interdomain is crucial to integrate the autonomous systems of the Internet, coalition
		networks can be essential in many missions settings. To satisfy the requirements of interdomain routing, BGP
		introduces path-vector routing as the foundation to achieve policy routing. Although there is some preliminary study
		of interdomain SDN (e.g., using IXPs), the networks that we study can be vastly different.
